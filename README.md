# Dotfiles

A repository with my personal configuration files.

Dotfiles uses [Dotbot](https://github.com/anishathalye/dotbot) for installation.

# Install

Set up dotfiles by cloning and running the install script:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/parker-norwood/dotfiles
cd dotfiles/
./install
```

# Relink

Add additional files to dotfiles, and relink.

```bash
./install --only link
```
